In this data project I focused on exploratory data analysis of stock prices. This project is just to practice my visualization and pandas skills, it is not meant to be a robust financial analysis or be taken as financial advice.
This project was quite challenging because I had to learn a lot of new concepts.
I  focused on bank stocks and see how they progressed throughout the [financial crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%9308) all the way to early 2016.
